  <h1>This is app</h1>
  <p>In a fully-formed application this page would be the single
    page application (SPA) client that would contain calls to the rest
    of the web service for its data (Think Twitter, Facebook...).
    But since this is not a full application it just does this.

    it is, head on over to

    developers' page</a>.</p>
